# MediLink ID / HealthConnect ID

## Project Summary

We propose developing a smart patient portal and NFC-enabled medical ID system that centralizes medical records, test results, medications, and appointments from multiple providers into one secure platform. The system will also allow patients to instantly share critical health information such as allergies, chronic conditions, and medications through a single NFC tap during emergencies, ensuring timely and accurate care while reducing fragmentation in healthcare record management.

## Challenge Statement/Objective

### Challenge 1: Fragmented Medical Records
The current challenge is the lack of centralized access to medical records. Patients often need to log in to multiple platforms or request records from different providers such as family doctors, walk-in clinics, and specialists, making it difficult to manage their health information. 

**Our Solution:** A patient portal/app that consolidates test results, medications, and upcoming appointments in one secure place.

### Challenge 2: Emergency Information Access
A second challenge arises during emergencies, when patients are repeatedly asked to provide personal information, medical history, and allergy details. 

**Our Solution:** Patients can share this critical information instantly via a single NFC tap, ensuring timely and accurate care.

## Description/Context

We are addressing a healthcare accessibility and data management challenge by designing a platform that unifies patient information across different medical providers. This solution spans the domains of **software engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, and **healthcare** by creating a smart, user-friendly system that improves record accessibility and enhances emergency response.

## Background

Currently, patients' medical information is fragmented across multiple platforms, requiring manual transfers of reports and repeated form-filling. While some healthcare systems have electronic records, they are often limited to a single hospital or clinic network. 

Our proposed solution offers a **universal, patient-centered platform** that centralizes medical records from family doctors, specialists, and walk-in clinics. By linking the platform to an NFC-enabled ID system, patients can securely share critical information such as chronic illnesses, medications, and allergies in emergencies. 

In the future, this system could:
- Reduce administrative burden
- Improve continuity of care
- Provide a foundation for AI-driven health insights
